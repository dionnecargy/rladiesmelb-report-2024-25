    "text": "Event Highlights:\n\nIncreasing diversity in R-Ladies São Paulo\nWe kicked off our 2024–25 committee events with an incredible session featuring international speaker Dr. Beatriz Milz, a co-organizer of R-Ladies São Paulo, Brazil!\n\n\nBeatriz shared her personal journey and community-building experiences, highlighting insights from her blog post published in April 2023.\nHer talk focused on the intentional steps taken by R-Ladies São Paulo to foster greater diversity and inclusivity within their chapter.\nTo better understand their community’s makeup and cultural context, the team conducted a community survey. The results made it clear: increasing diversity—especially among underrepresented groups—requires a collective, community-wide effort. Based on the findings, the chapter implemented impactful actions, including reserving participation spots (via quotas) for three key groups:\n\nBlack, Brown, and Indigenous people\nMothers\nWomen and other gender minorities\n\nOne of the most inspiring initiatives is their “GuGuDaDos” collaborative space—a program that provides support for parents by hiring primary school teachers to engage children during R-Ladies events. This thoughtful solution helps ensure that caretakers can fully participate in community activities.\nR-Ladies São Paulo has also launched several other innovative and empowering programs that serve as a powerful inspiration to R-Ladies chapters around the world.\nWe’re so grateful to Beatriz for sharing her story and for sparking meaningful conversations about inclusion, equity, and collective responsibility within our community.\n\n\nIt Takes a Spark 2024: Become a Disease Detective\nThis year, Kathleen and I presented at the annual It Takes A Spark conference at The Knox School (see here), armed with our bookdown and quarto slides developed in our 2023 iteration.\n\n\nThis marked the fifth year R-Ladies Melbourne had participated in the conference!\nAlthough a fire alarm abruptly finished our session early, we came away with a lot of interesting points to grow the program for 2025!\n\n\nLeveraging the Power of Data in Sport\nWe were thrilled to have an incredible in-person turnout at this R-Ladies Melbourne event - the energy in the room was amazing! This meetup was particularly special as it marked our first time being generously sponsored and hosted by DIUS, whose support helped make the evening a great success.\nAttendees were treated to insightful talks by two outstanding speakers from the Australian Football League: Elisa Koch, Head of Data and Analytics, and Lauren Boothby, Senior Data Analyst. They shared their expertise and experiences on Leveraging the Power of Data in Sport, offering a fascinating look into how analytics is transforming the world of professional sports. A huge thank you to Elisa, Lauren, and everyone who joined us!\n\n\nEnd of Year Networking Event\nOur end-of-year networking event at The Clyde in Carlton was a fantastic success, bringing together an enthusiastic community to celebrate the close of 2024. We were joined by five incredible mentors—Jovana (Senior Research Associate at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre), Kirsty McCann (Associate Research Fellow, Genomic Epidemiology), Victoria (Software Engineering Senior Consultant at DiUS), Anna Quaglieri (Senior Bioinformatics Data Scientist at Mass Dynamics), and Kate Saunders (Lecturer at Monash University) - who generously shared their career journeys, insights, and advice that brought them to their current roles in areas ranging from public health, genomics, bioinformatics, programming and software engineering!\nIt was a wonderful evening of connection, learning, and celebration, and a perfect way to wrap up another great year for R-Ladies Melbourne!\n\n\nInspiring the Next Generation: R-Ladies Melb at “It Takes A Spark” Conference\nWe began the year with a planned event where I was set to speak about our involvement in the It Takes a Spark Conference. Attendance was lower than expected, likely due to the event occurring in February, and so we decided to reschedule the session for a later date to ensure broader engagement.\n\n\nPGEforge: towards an open analysis ecosystem for malaria genomic epidemiology\nOur most recent event was an intellectually enriching experience that brought together researchers and practitioners to explore how cutting-edge genomic tools can be used to support malaria control efforts. We were delighted to host former R-Ladies Melbourne president Dr. Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez as our international guest speaker, who shared groundbreaking work on translating Plasmodium genomic data into actionable insights for national malaria programs.\nShazia introduced us to PGEforge, an open-access platform designed to streamline and standardize malaria genomic data analysis. Developed through the collaborative efforts of the PlasmoGenEpi network, PGEforge brings together workflows, software evaluations, and reproducible tutorials to support users in effectively applying genomic tools for molecular surveillance. Her talk highlighted the importance of interoperability, community-driven development, and practical use cases—underscoring how platforms like PGEforge are transforming the way genomic data can be used to inform real-world public health decision-making. We left inspired by the innovative work being done and energized by the global collaboration driving it forward."

    "text": "Branding Change: R-Ladies to R-Ladies+\n\nAs of March 14, 2025, R-Ladies Global broadcast that there will be a rebrand to R-Ladies+ as shown in this blog post in response to community feedback that the name “R-Ladies” does not fully reflect the diversity of under-represented genders it aims to support.\nThis change aims to foster broader inclusivity while maintaining the organization’s globally recognized identity. After months of open discussion, the “+” was chosen over a complete name change to avoid confusion, preserve accessibility across languages, and accommodate the limited capacity of the organization’s volunteer-led structure. The re-branding will include a new visual identity and improved social infrastructure, empowering chapters to adopt the changes in ways that align with their local context and safety considerations. This effort reaffirms R-Ladies+’s commitment to fostering an inclusive and welcoming R community for all under-represented gender minorities."

Year.\nWhile we haven’t yet fully returned to hosting regular monthly meetings post-COVID, we’ve made great strides in rebuilding our committee, which is incredibly committed and eager to take R-Ladies Melbourne to new heights. I’m immensely proud of the team behind the scenes, who have worked hard to organize engaging and meaningful meetups. A major highlight of the year was our End of Year Networking Event, where we had the opportunity to connect with so many amazing people, engage with insightful mentors, and foster discussions around R coding in a fun, supportive environment. As we head into the next 2025-26 committee year, I’m looking forward to hosting more inspiring events, deep-dive coding events, welcoming diverse voices, and continuing to empower under-represented genders in the R community.\n💜"
